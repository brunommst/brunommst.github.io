    </header>
    <p>Hello again! My name is Bruno Santos <span class="italic small-text">(in case you haven't seen the 100px sized one on the front)</span> and I'm a Digital Designer from Lisbon who loves to explore, experiment and have fun with the web.</p>
    <br>    
    <p><span class="bold">Design</span>, <span class="bold">Code</span>, <span class="bold">Multidisciplinarity</span>, <span class="bold">Experimentation</span> and <span class="bold italic">the ability to Google my way through anything</span> are my best traits. I really want to get technology and design into the hands of people through new forms of interaction in digital experiences. <br>Websites and apps are getting boring, design has reached a weird state where digital interfaces that are becoming too familiar — <span class="underline">and even though there is obviously a time and a place for them</span> — I feel like it's taking the <span class="bold">joy and the excitement</span> out of the web. That's why I always try to create by breaking some rules and focusing my research in endless experimentation <span class="italic small-text">while abusing digital tools as much as possible</span> to hopefully bring some of it back.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Currently <span class="italic">(as of July 2019)</span>, I just finished my Postgraduate in Digital Experience Design and I'm starting a new chapter working at <a href="https://with-company.com/" class="bold">With Company</a> in sunny Lisbon, where I hope to grow as a designer and bring some great projects to life while working with great people and have some fun doing it. <br><a href="mailto:hello@bru-no.com?subject=I really want to talk to you!&body=Hi Bruno — I'm really cool cause I clicked that link to actually talk to you!">Let me know if you want to chat!</a></p>
