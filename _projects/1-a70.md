description: "Designed and implemented a dynamic website for Anjos70. This was a very challenging project where I learned a lot about performance optimization, backoffice integration and dynamic content fetching.<br>The website changes monthly to accommodate the ever changing events hosted on the venue, but also the design chosen for each month."
