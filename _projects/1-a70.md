description: Designed and implemented a dynamic website for Anjos70. A challenging
  project where I learned a lot about performance optimisation, back-office integration
  and dynamic content fetching.<br>The website changes monthly to accommodate the
  ever changing events hosted on the venue, but also the design chosen for each month.
