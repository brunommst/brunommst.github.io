  Contributed to a systemic design project reimagining how organizations like <a href="https://www.undp.org/" target="_blank">United Nations Development Programme</a> could reform and evolve to tackle complex planetary challenges. Rooted in insights from the Strategic Plan 2022-2025 and the Human Development Report 2022, this work leveraged speculative design and future-thinking methodologies to explore radical transformations in global developmentâ€”envisioning new ways of organizing, working, and living.
