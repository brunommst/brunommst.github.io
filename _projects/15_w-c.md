description: 'What started out as an idea for a website that could scroll diagonally
  turned into a case study of a social media platform aimed at creatives who want
  to share their unfinished projects, experimentations, tests or errors without having
  to polish them for an instagram or a behance post. W—C was envisioned and prototyped
  in my first year of college and later turned into a full case study for a course
  on UI design in my Post-Grad year. '
