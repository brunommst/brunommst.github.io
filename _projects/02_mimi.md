  Co-designed and implemented a dynamic website for Anjos70. A challenging project where I learned a lot about Wordpress integration, optimisation and dynamic content fetching.
  The website changes monthly to accommodate the ever changing events hosted on the venue, as well as the visual queues chosen for each month, such as colour and typography.
