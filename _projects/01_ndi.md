  Co-led the rebranding of NDI, evolving its identity to better reflect establish its role in the future of video-over-IP. The new design system balances flexibility and consistency, ensuring a strong, modern brand presence across digital and physical touchpoints. Since then, I've continued working bringing the NDI brand presence and consistency to both marketing campaigns and internal products.
