description: Co-designed and implemented the website for Promenade, a young film production
  house in Lisbon. This project was a great opportunity to push my skills both as
  a designer and a developer. From typography, to navigation and visuals, having full
  creative control over the entire project led to what I believe is my best freelance
  work so far.
