description: mint is a UX/UI case study that aims to reinvent the traditionally confusing
  interface of photo cameras by giving it a modern experience with intuitive smartphone-like
  features and a simpler and more approachable interface that provides a faster learning
  curve for all kinds of users. mint also has a cloud based ecosystem that focuses
  on easier sharing options like multi-device synchronisation and a simple photo management
  system on the go.
