  What started out as an idea for a website that would scroll diagonally,
  turned into a case study of a social media platform aimed at creatives who want
  to share their unfinished projects, experimentations, tests or errors without having to polish them for an instagram or a behance post. W—C was envisioned and prototyped in my first year of college and later turned into a full case study for a course on UI design in my Post-Grad year.
