description: "Raise is donation service case study. It was designed with one thing in mind: Get more people donating money! <br>Sounds hard, but really it shouldn't. People generally like to give money and those who can don't feel comfortable doing it; organizations, the smaller they are the less direct platforms to create and share campaigns they have; and finally companies like to be associated with good causes but don't have the pressure to do it.<br>With all this in mind we set out to create an MVP for a service that accommodates all of these parties' needs and connects them to bring more money to those who need it."
